### Hello there 👋

I am currently studying Game Design at Tischner European School and this is my projects&practise storage :D 

### ⭐About me ⭐
I am an ambitious, creative and highly people-oriented person. I work great with teams, striking passion and engagement in every project I set my mind to. I take huge pleasure in learning new skills and researching new technics, especially for my art. 🎨🖌️

A 5-levels game in UE4. It served as a learning opportunity for engine mechanics & tools. I learned how to create blueprints, spline, character animations, quick time events, widgets.
