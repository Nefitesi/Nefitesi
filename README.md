### Hello there üëã

I am currently studying Game Design at Tischner European School and this is my projects&practise storage :D 

### ‚≠êAbout me ‚≠ê
I am an ambitious, creative and highly people-oriented person. I work great with teams, striking passion and engagement in every project I set my mind to. I take huge pleasure in learning new skills and researching new technics, especially for my art. üé®üñåÔ∏è

### Cave of Wonders
A 5-levels game in UE4. It served as a learning opportunity for engine mechanics & tools. I learned how to create blueprints, spline, character animations, quick time events, widgets.

### Broken wagon scene
For practise, I created a scene using Unreal Engine 5, while modelling all the plants and a broken wagon in Blender.

### Blender Low Poly Character - domestica
I wanted to try out a different style so I followed a Domestica tutorial (https://www.domestika.org/pl/courses/567-modelowanie-postaci-low-poly-w-grach-wideo) to create a low poly character in Blender.

### Game design plan
To understand all stages of game developement process, I took part in a group project that aimed to prepare a sensable game concept inculding pitching phase, designing features, game pillars and initial proof of concept.
